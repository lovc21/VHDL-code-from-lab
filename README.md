# VHDL Code for Lab Projects in Integrated Circuits and Design Course

This repository contains the VHDL code for lab projects I completed during a course in Integrated Circuits and Design. For more information on these projects, please visit the course website: https://lniv.fe.uni-lj.si/b.html.

The main focus of this repository is on the Generator Tonov Jakob project, which I upgraded to display different frequencies and tones.
